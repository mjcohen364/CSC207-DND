CSC207 Group Project - Group 56
# A description of the problem domain we are tentatively wanting to focus on in the project:
We want to tackle a mix of an Adventure Game and a Tabletop Board Game. We would pull from a classic TableTop RPG and use a Dungeons & Dragons API to provide our code with items, classes, stats, and other information we could use in the game.

# A brief, high-level description of what kind of application we are thinking of developing:
We plan on developing a battle system for a TableTop-styled RPG, with health, damage, enemies, items, spells, and probabilities based on stats and information pulled from a Dungeons & Dragons API. We could have a grid-based map that player controlled characters move and fight on. Speed would be received from the Dungeons & Dragons API and would be used to determine how far a player or enemy can move in one turn. Attack options and their respective ranges would also be determined using values pulled from the API. Depending on scope of the project, we could produce just the combat system, or a rogue-like system where players retain items and stats from previous battles into any future battle until they die, after which they restart with basic stats and abilities, or we could produce a short story for the player to complete.
We also may implement other elements of a TableTop RPG, such as item shopping or interacting with pre-written NPCs.

(Two potential D&D APIs, will delete the other once we choose which one to implement)
