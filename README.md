CSC207 Group Project - Group 56
# A description of the problem domain we are tentatively wanting to focus on in the project:
We want to tackle a mix of an Adventure Game and a Tabletop Board Game. We would pull from a classic TableTop RPG and use a Dungeons & Dragons API to provide our code with items, classes, stats, and other information we could use in the game.

# A brief, high-level description of what kind of application we are thinking of developing:
We plan on developing a battle system for a TableTop-styled RPG, with health, damage, enemies, items, spells, and probabilities based on stats and information pulled from a Dungeons & Dragons API. We also may implement other elements of a TableTop RPG, such as item shopping or interacting with pre-written NPCs.

# A link to the documentation for an API your team can use related to the domain:

(Two potential D&D APIs, will delete the other once we choose which one to implement)
